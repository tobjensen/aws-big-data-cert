Collection of notes from studying for the AWS big data certification

## AWS Products

Exam is divided into six domains: Collection, Storage, Processing, Analysis, Visualization, and Data Security. In order to pass the exam, you need deep knowledge about the AWS products covered within these six fields.

The questions on the exam go deep into the function and intricacies of the AWS *products* in these domains, not general domain knowledge. As such, having good knowledge generally about the domains and shallow knowledges about individual products *will not cut it*. 

Here are the AWS products covered in the exam, in order of importance.

* Redshift
* Kinesis
    * Data Streams
    * Firehose
    * Analytics
    * Video Streams
* DynamoDB
* EMR
* Athena
* Hadoop (Apache) tools & Ecosystem
* IoT Core & Device Management
* CloudWatch / CloudTrail
* Quicksight
* S3
* IAM
* Glue
* Lambda
* CloudSearch
* Elasticsearch Service
* RDS

The intricacies, concepts, limitations, encryption options, logging, access, and best practice recommendations for these products are covered in the exam at a deep level.
